Strassen Algorithm
============================================================================



Basic Information
=================

The Strassen algorithm, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. It is faster than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm for large matrices, with a better asymptotic complexity.

Problem to Solve
================

In the project we try to implement strassen algorithm with C++. Plus, we try to learn some skills ( if its suitable ) to improve the speedup of strassen algorithm.



Prospective Users
=================

Someone who try to learn matrix multiplication and how it is implemented.

System Architecture
===================
